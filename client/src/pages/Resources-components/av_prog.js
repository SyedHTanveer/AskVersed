There are four rounds. First, in the team round, teams work collaborate to solve short-answer questions. Then, in the power round, teams use various methods of mathematical analysis and proof to expand and generalize on a specific topic in the form of a report. Next, the individual round requires team members to work independently on a set of questions for a short period of time. Finally, the relay round delegates work to “sub-teams” within a team, and the problem is solved in stages. ",

Through science and technology applications like targeted drug delivery, smart materials, molecular motors, advanced sensors and artificial red blood cells, we may not have to wait until that fateful day when we're bitten by a radioactive spider in order to become superhuman.\n\nNSF and the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) are excited to continue Generation Nano: Superheroes Inspired by Science! While Gen Nano started as a competition based on nanotechnology, we are thrilled to expand the competition to all fields of science and engineering. The competition asks middle and high school students to use scientific research to drive or equip an original superhero. Students can envision science that is grounded in current research but not yet possible, allowing them to learn about the potentials and limitations of real-world science and technology.",

The challenge’s weight and time requirements encourage compactness, light weight, high performance and efficiency. As part of the competition -- before their first time on the course -- rover entries are tested to see that they would fit into a lander equipment bay, a maximum 5 feet by 5 feet by 5 feet in volume. Teams earn points by assembling the rover in the allotted time; designing a rover that is lightweight; successfully completing course obstacles; performing tasks throughout the mission; and meeting pre- and post-challenge requirements. Each team is permitted two excursions: The greater score of the two excursions will be used for the final team score.",

Tragically, Dr. Hannemann passed away suddenly in July 2001, and in 2003, SME announced that the organization was unable to continue sponsorship of the event.\n\nMost thought that this was the end, but as with all things, every end can be a new beginning. This new beginning was realized by three educators from Marion, Ohio.  On the bus ride from Rochester to Marion, Ed Goodwin, Ritch Ramey, and Tad Douce discussed the possibilities and support that existed in their community for this type of event.  In 2004 the name was changed from SME/RTEC to the National Robotics Challenge. From its humble beginning, with two work cells and two pick and place competitions, the competition now offers twelve robotics contests.\nThe best is yet to come!",

Through the manufacturing process of Bot building, students’ imaginations are captured as they design, build and compete with their own robotic creations. Through this hands-on effort along with industry partnerships, students gain practical knowledge of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) – all essential skills for manufacturing.\n\nBy formalizing ties between schools or youth organizations and manufacturing partners, students gain a better understanding and become enthusiastic about the career possibilities in manufacturing. Also, manufacturers are able to build valuable industry-school connections and workforce talent pipelines by helping competitors engineer a lean, mean, fighting machine. In other words, everybody wins.",

Over the years, Rob built out the on-line infrastructure of the USACO to allow us to run monthly competitions at multiple levels of difficulty each year, in addition to the final US Open competition. Together with legendary coach Hal Burch, Rob also established the USACO training pages, which have helped teach algorithmic problem-solving to tens of thousands of students from around 90 countries worldwide. After Don and Rob's retirement from running USACO, the organization is currently headed up by Dr. Brian Dean, a computer science professor at Clemson University who has been a member of the USACO staff for more than two decades.\n\nUSA teams attending the IOI have shown steady and consistent improvement in their performance over the years, and the USA now regularly places among the top countries attending the IOI. The following is a list of all of our past IOI team members and the medals they earned at IOI. Please click below to see more information about the finalists and team for a particular year.",

Carefully written justifications are required for each problem. The problems range in difficulty from being within the reach of most high school students to challenging the best students in the nation. Students may use any materials - books, calculators, computers - but all the work must be their own. The USAMTS is run on the honor system - it is an individual competition, whose competitive role is very secondary. (Although we do give prizes.)",
